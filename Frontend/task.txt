Goal
    Develop a responsive application that displays and manages user data from an external API.
    The application should provide a professional user interface with a table-like layout and modal interaction for user details.

Tools
    ● React or other framework with TypeScript
    ● CSS Modules for styling
    ● JSONPlaceholder user API for test data (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)

Initial Data
    The application fetches user data from the JSONPlaceholder API. Each user object contains the following information:
    export interface Geo {
      lat: string;
      lng: string;
    }

    export interface Address {
      street: string;
      suite: string;
      city: string;
      zipcode: string;
      geo: Geo;
    }

    export interface Company {
      name: string;
      catchPhrase: string;
      bs: string;
    }

    export interface User {
      id: number;
      name: string;
      username: string;
      email: string;
      address: Address;
      phone: string;
      website: string;
      company: Company;
    }

3. User Management:
    ● Implement ability to delete users from the list (client-side only)
